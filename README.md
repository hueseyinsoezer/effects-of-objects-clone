# effects-of-objects-clone
Unlike my previous clones, it is a clone where I applied sound effects, particle effects and other effects. 
This clone is a resource from "Junior Programmer: Create with Code 2". 
I can develop this clone later. 
For those who want to review the code, I mean have fun in advance.
